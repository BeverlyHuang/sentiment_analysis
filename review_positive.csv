Temperature reduction system is not working properly as shown on the control panel. Overall hotel management service is noteworthy. Trip to airport at the time of departure kept me out of anxiety.	"A pleasant and highly comfortable stay. at Hyatt Regency, Kathmandu"		Sultan	Taragaon Boudha	Hotels	Alliance	US	27.7216	85.355959	Hyatt Regency Kathmandu	44601	OH	2016-06-30T00:00:00Z	2016-11-11T23:48:28Z			10	Nothing as such. The city is in a bad shape and the pollution and dirt doesnot allow you to roam much but the resort was fantastic. Swimming Pool and Jogging Track was a delight. Casino Pride was also amazing.

Very disappointing when you can hear all the details people do in there. The bedroom was fabulous with a very large comfortable bed, the bathroom instilled a real sense of calm in me with a luxurious sized bath and a large walk-in shower. The breakfast room was immensely superb with high ceilingwith a vast selection of foods. The swimming pool is a good size and I love it being outdoors. The 24hr gym is well equipped and I had a great massage in the spa."

The layout of the rooms seems more like an apartment than a hotel room. And love the fireplace next to the excellent view of the beach.	Can't wait to come back next year!

It was a very congested area, where you had to pick up food and then take it back to your room to eat. Great view of the ocean, a nice patio we could sit outside and listen to the waves hit the shore. Immediate beach access. Very comfy bed, nice heavy curtains so it was dark and restful. Breakfast choices were good. Loved it."	"Fantastic view - Wonderful, quiet place to relax and enjoy the ocean."
